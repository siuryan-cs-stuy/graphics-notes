# Relative Coordinate System

Currently, we generate triangles/edges first and then apply transformations to those matricies.

In a RCS, transformations are applied to the "current" coordinate system, which modifies shapes as soon as they are generated.

```
[1 0 0 0]  [2 0 0 3]
[0 1 0 0]  [0 2 0 1]
[0 0 1 0]  [0 0 2 0]
[0 0 0 1]  [0 0 0 1]
    A          B
```

## Drawing in a RCS

1. Generate polygons/edges
2. Modify those points by the current coordinate system
3. Draw to the image

Example
```
rotate
x 90
sphere
-------
ident
rotate
y 30
rotate
z 20
box
```

## Coordinate System Stack

- We will maintain a stack of coordinate systems
- The bottom will always be the identity matrix
- Push will push a copy of the current top
- Transformations will be applied to the top

Example
```
push
move
box
push
move
sphere
pop
```

Example

stack should be top*transformation

| command | stack           |
|---------|-----------------|
| push    | `I I`           |
| move    | `I*M1 I`        |
| box     |                 |
| push    | `I*M1 I*M1 I`   |
| rotate  | `I*M1*R I*M1 I` |
