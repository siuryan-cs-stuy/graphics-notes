# Making Curves

## Parametric Equations
- Define a cruve as a system of equations with an independent variable (t)

```
x = f(t)
y = g(t)
z = h(t)
```

Line `(x0, y0)` -> `(x1, y1)`, `t: 0 -> 1`
```
f(t) = (Δx)t + x0
g(t) = (Δy)t + y0
```

## General Parametric Framework

```
for t:0 -> 1
  x = f(t)
  y = g(t)
  z = h(t)
  add(x,y,z)
```

## Circles

```
x = rcosθ + x0 = rcos(2πt) + x0
y = rsinθ + y0 = rsin(2πt) + y0
0 <= θ < 2π
θ = 2πt
```

## Splines
- Special curves that can be designed to connect smoothly
- We will only use cubic splines

### Hermite Curves
- Given:
  - `P0, P1`: endpoints
  - `R0, R1`: rate of change at each point

```
f(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d   // points on the curve
f'(t) = 3at^2 + 2bt + c       // rates of change
```

When `t = 0`, `f(t) = d` (P0) and `f'(t) = c` (R0)
When `t = 1`, `f(t) = a+b+c+d` (P1) and `f'(t) = 3a+2b+c` (R1)

```
    H        C     G
[0 0 0 1]   [a]   [P0]
[1 1 1 1]   [b]   [P1]
[0 0 1 0] x [c] = [P2]
[3 2 1 0]   [d]   [P3]
```

H x C = G
H^-1 x G = C
```
    H^-1        G      C
[2 -2  1 1]   [x0 ]   [ax]
[-3 3 -2 1]   [x1 ]   [bx]
[0  0  1 0] x [Rx0] = [cx]
[1  0  0 0]   [Rx1]   [dx]
```
