# Making Curves

## Parametric Equations
- Define a cruve as a system of equations with an independent variable (t)

```
x = f(t)
y = g(t)
z = h(t)
```

Line `(x0, y0)` -> `(x1, y1)`, `t: 0 -> 1`
```
f(t) = (Δx)t + x0
g(t) = (Δy)t + y0
```

## General Parametric Framework

```
for t:0 -> 1
  x = f(t)
  y = g(t)
  z = h(t)
  add(x,y,z)
```

## Circles

```
x = rcosθ + x0 = rcos(2πt) + x0
y = rsinθ + y0 = rsin(2πt) + y0
0 <= θ < 2π
θ = 2πt
```

## Splines
- Special curves that can be designed to connect smoothly
- We will only use cubic splines
- Hermite, Bezier splines
