# Shading Models

How/when we calculate the color for our shapes

## Flat Shading
  - Calculate I once per polygon

## Gouraud Shading
  - Calculate I three times per polygon (at the verticies)
  - Interpolate I in scanline conversion and draw line

## Phong Shading
- Calculate I once per pixel
- Interpolate the surface normal in scanline conversion and draw line

### Calculating surface normals
- Every point on a polygon has the same surface normal

#### Vertex normals
- Normal value calculated by combining the surface normals of all polygons that share the same vertex
- Combination of all surface noramls for polygons that share a common vertex

```
Polygons: [V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5]
           |---P0---|  |---P1---|

Vertex normals: [V0: N0...]
```

- Create a hash table of verticies: normals and update as you go through the polygon list
- At the end, we will normalize all the vertex normals
- We should normalize the surface normals before adding them to the vertex normal

```
v0 = (N-hat0 + N-hat1)-hat
```
