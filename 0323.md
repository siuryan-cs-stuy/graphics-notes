# Wireframe Mesh

Shape is defined by the edges that connect points on the surface.

Flow to make wireframe mesh:
1. add box
2. add edge
3. add point
4. draw lines
5. draw line

## Polygon Mesh

Shape is defined by the polygons that connect points on the surface C.
(triangles)

### Polygon Matrix

Edge Matrix:
```
[P0P1, P1P2, P2P0, ...]
```

Polygon Matrix:
```
[P0P1P2, P2P3P4]
 |_T0_|  |_T1_|
```

Flow to create Polygon Mesh:

1. add box
2. add polygon
3. add point
4. draw polygons
5. draw line

Points must be added counter-clockwise.

## Backface Culling

Only draws the polygons that are forward-facing.

Normal vector __N__ is perpendicular to the surface.

View vector __V__ is the vector from the surface to the viewer.

1. Calculate __N__.

__N__ = __A__ x __B__
__A__ = `<P1-P0>`
__B__ = `<P2-P0>`

2. Find θ.

__N__ · __V__ = ||__N__||*||__V__||*cosθ

__V__ = <0, 0, 1>

Only the z component of __N__ determines drawing; if __N__z is positive, draw.

3. If -90° < θ < 90°, draw polygon.
