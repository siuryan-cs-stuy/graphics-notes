# Lighting

The color of an object is based on:
1. The reflective properties of the object
2. The color, intensity, and location of any light sources

## Types of Light Sources
- Ambient
  - General light in an image
  - Comes from all locations equally
- Point Light Source
  - Comes from a specific location (far away)

## Phong Reflection Model
- Models real world reflection by breaking reflection into 3 parts
  - Ambient
  - Diffuse (point source)
  - Specular (point source)
- `I = Ambient + Diffuse + Specular`

## Ambient Reflection
- A: Ambient light (0-255)
- Ka: constant of ambient reflection (0-1)
- `Ambient = A*Ka`

## Diffuse Reflection
- Reflection of a point source
- Light is reflected back evenly in all directions
- Matte/dull objects

### Calculation
- __L__: vector from the surface to the light (__L-hat__ is normalized)
- θ: angle between __N__ (normal vector to surface) and __L__
- `cosθ = N-hat • L-hat`
- P: point light color (0-255)
- Kd: constant of diffuse reflection (0-1)
- `Diffuse = P*Kd*(N-hat • L-hat)`

## Specular Reflection
- Reflects a point source in a specific direction
- Models glossy/shiny surfaces
- Strength of a specular reflection is based on:
  - The angle between __R__ and __V__ (α)
  - The angle between __L__ and __N__ (θ)

### Calculation

- __L__: vector from the surface to the light (__L-hat__ is normalized)
- θ: angle between __N__ (normal vector to surface) and __L__
- α: angle between __R__ and __V__ (α)
- __R__: reflected vector from the surface


We want `R-hat • V-hat`.
```
R = T + S
S = T - L
R = T + T - L
```
