# Lighting

The color of an object is based on:
1. The reflective properties of the object
2. The color, intensity, and location of any light sources

## Types of Light Sources
- Ambient
  - General light in an image
  - Comes from all locations equally
- Point Light Source
  - Comes from a specific location (far away)

## Phong Reflection Model
- Models real world reflection by breaking reflection into 3 parts
  - Ambient
  - Diffuse (point source)
  - Specular (point source)
- `I = Ambient + Diffuse + Specular`

## Ambient Reflection
- A: Ambient light (0-255)
- Ka: constant of ambient reflection (0-1)
- `Ambient = A*Ka`

## Diffuse Reflection
- Reflection of a point source
- Light is reflected back evenly in all directions
- Matte/dull objects
