# Bresenham's Line Algorithm

Divide 2D plane into octants

## Octant I
__Assume__: Drawing a line in octant I (0 < m < 1)

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   | x |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
| x |   |   |   |   |

### Pixel options
- `(x+1, y+1)`
- `(x+1, y)`

### Determining best pixel

#### Method 1
- `f(x,y) = 0` if `(x,y)` is on the line
- Compare `f(x+1, y+1)` and `f(x+1, y)` --> smaller value is closer to the actual line

#### Method 2
If `f(x+1, y+1/2)` (the midpoint):

|       | location of `(x+1, y+1/2)` | pixel to draw |
| `= 0` | on the line                | either        |
| `> 0` | above the line             | lower         |
| `< 0` | below the line             | upper         |
