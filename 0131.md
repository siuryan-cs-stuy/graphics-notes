# Peering into the depths of color

## Color Depth
The amount of data used to represent a single pixel

| size   | color options                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 bit  | 1 color, on/off                           |
| 2 bit  | 1 color, on/off, plus 1 bit for intensity |
| 3 bit  | RGB, on/off                               |
| 4 bit  | RBG with intensity                        |
| 6 bit  | RGB, each color has its own intensity     |
| 3 byte | RGB, each with 256 possible intensities   |

## Other Color Spaces
- RGBA
  - Red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency)
- HSB
  - Hue, saturation, brightness

## Image File Formats

### Raster vs. Vector
- Vector formats represent images as a series of drawing instructions
  - Infinitely scalable
  - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- Raster formats represent images as a grid of pixels

<!-- 02/01 -->

### Uncompressed vs. Compressed (Raster)
- Uncompressed formats contain data for each pixel
  - BMP, TIFF, RAW
- Compressed formats use a compression algorithm to mimimize the file size

#### Lossless vs. Lossy
- Lossless compression algorithms contain enough information to exactly recreate the original image
  - PNG (Portable Network Graphics), GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
- Lossy compression algorithms do not retain all the details of the original image
  - JPEG (Joint Photographics Experts Group)

### Formats
1. PPM (Portable PixMap)
  1. Lossless, uncompressed raster format
  2. Pixel data is represented by RGB tripets in either ASCII or binary
  3. All whitespace is equivalent

example:
```
1. P3
2. 4 3
3. 255
4. 255 0 0  255 0 0  255 0 0  255 0 0
5. 0 255 0  0 255 0  0 255 0  0 255 0
6. 0 0 255  0 0 255  0 0 255  0 0 255
```

#### Converting and Viewing Image
```bash
$ convert <pic>.ppm <pic>.png
$ display <pic>.png
```
