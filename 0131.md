# Peering into the depths of color

## Color Depth
The amount of data used to represent a single pixel

| size   | color options                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 bit  | 1 color, on/off                           |
| 2 bit  | 1 color, on/off, plus 1 bit for intensity |
| 3 bit  | RGB, on/off                               |
| 4 bit  | RBG with intensity                        |
| 6 bit  | RGB, each color has its own intensity     |
| 3 byte | RGB, each with 256 possible intensities   |

## Image File Formats

### Raster vs. Vector

  - Infinitely scalable
  - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- Raster formats represent images as a grid of pixels
